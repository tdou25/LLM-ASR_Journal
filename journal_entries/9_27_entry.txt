9/27 entry

This week I primarily familiarized myself with the existing work for the
project. This project is a research endeavor run by professor Mei Si 
from the cognitive science department, trying to develop means of 
enhancing automatic speech recognition using ASRs. Much of the work is already done, 
so this semester, the goal will be to develop techniques for edge cases 
like accents or english of different time periods.

I spent time reading the research paper in particular. The overall 
approach is corrective, meaning it utilizes Phoenix LLM to check the 
n-best ASR results and suggest corrections. I also spent time doing paperwork
to gain access to AiMOS, the machine used to train the model.

I'm unsure of how I may contribute in the future, although I have a few ideas

1. familiarize myself with Whisper, and try to run it locally.
2. find datasets that could supplement research, as Librispeech is the only
dataset used now.
3. catalog the performance of the model on other datasets.
