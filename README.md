RCOS LLM-ASR Journal
Thomas Dou

The purpose of this repository is to retroactively create a journal of my learning process when joining the LLM-ASR project at the beginning of the semester, as well as to explain my lack of commits prior to the mid-year commit summary. 

Entries will be added in ~2 day intervals to emulate the time between when they would have been committed during the first few weeks.

Entries to this in the journal_entries directory will take the form of plain-text files and will be titled in the following format:
    mm_dd_entry.txt

The parent directory will contain scratch code and other experimental code I make that won't be committed to the main project repo.

The Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS) is an organization based out of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) committed to advancing the cause of open source by creating an environment where new open source projects can find collaborators and thrive. Students (such as myself) may take RCOS as a course, where they join an existing project (or create their own) and are graded on the quality of their contributions.

LLM-ASR is one such project. This project is an ongoing research project by professor Mei Si of the RPI COGS department. The project aims to enhance ASRs using LLMs and a prompt-based approach. For more information, contact Dr. Mei Si.
